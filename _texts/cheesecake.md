### Method

1. **Prepare the base**:
   - Preheat the oven to 160°C/310°F/gas 2½ and grease a 24cm loose-bottomed cake tin.
   - Blend the biscuits into fine crumbs using a food processor, or crush them manually with a rolling pin.  
   - Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press the mixture evenly into the base of the tin.  
   - Place the tin on a baking sheet and chill in the fridge while preparing the filling.

2. **Make the filling**:
   - In a food processor (or by hand), blend the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the sugar, then the eggs one at a time, mixing well.  
   - Add the lime juice and blend until just combined. The mixture will be thin, which is normal.  
   - Pour the filling over the chilled biscuit base and bake for 45–55 minutes, until the centre has a slight wobble.  
   - Cool for 15 minutes and increase the oven temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.

3. **Make the meringue topping**:
   - Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form (an electric whisk is helpful). Gradually add the caster sugar, beating until thick and glossy.  
   - Fold in the desiccated coconut.  

4. **Assemble and bake**:
   - Spoon the meringue onto the cooled cheesecake, spreading it to the edges and creating peaks. The layer should be about 2cm thick.  
   - Bake for 5 minutes, until the meringue is golden and crisp.  

5. **Chill and serve**:
   - Let the cheesecake cool completely, then chill in the fridge for a few hours.  
   - Carefully remove it from the tin and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle with lime zest.  
   - Serve with fresh mango, strawberries, or raspberries when in season.
