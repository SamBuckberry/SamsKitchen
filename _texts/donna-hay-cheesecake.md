### Method

1. **Prepare the base**:
   - Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).  
   - Place the flour, sugar, and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Process for one minute or until a rough dough forms.  
   - Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of a lightly greased 20cm round springform tin lined with non-stick baking paper.  
   - Bake the base for 25 minutes or until golden and just cooked. Set aside.  

2. **Make the filling**:
   - Place the sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, lemon juice, lemon rind, ricotta, and eggs in a food processor. Process until smooth.  
   - Mix the cornflour and water in a small bowl until smooth. Add this mixture to the cream cheese mixture and mix to combine.  

3. **Assemble and bake**:
   - Pour the filling over the cooked base. Tap the tin gently to remove any air bubbles.  
   - Bake for 40 minutes or until the filling is set and light.  

4. **Cool and serve**:
   - Allow the cheesecake to cool in the tin.  
   - Serve with mixed berries and dust with icing sugar.  

Enjoy this simple yet elegant dessert!
