I have fond memories of my Grandpa making these pancakes for dessert when I was a kid. 

From Grandma's recipe book: 
A treasured family recipe passed down through generations, Dorothy J's Buttermilk Hot Cakes are a classic breakfast treat. These hot cakes were first made by MaryAnne's mother, Dorothy J, and have been enjoyed for over 60 years. 

This recipe was shared by Grandma (Dawn Buckberry) in her collection, and it holds a special place in our hearts.

### Note
This recipe was recorded in Grandma's diary from her American trip in June 1994, when she visited MaryAnne and Al Reimer at their Corralitos Ranch in California.  

During her two-week stay, Grandma enjoyed wonderful moments with MaryAnne in her art studio, exploring San Francisco, attending "The Phantom of the Opera," and visiting Monterey.  

One morning, MaryAnne made these hot cakes for breakfast, serving them with maple syrup, eggs, and meat. Grandma described them as the best she’d ever had and made sure to get the recipe.  

The recipe originally belonged to MaryAnne's mother, Dorothy J, who was an artist and lived to the age of 92, passing away in 1993. Dorothy J was fondly remembered as "quite a Gal."
