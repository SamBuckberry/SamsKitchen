# Classic Bolognese Sauce Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 large onions, finely diced
- 4 carrots, finely diced
- 4 celery stalks, finely diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork, ideally 70% beef, 30% pork)
- 1 cup (240 ml) whole milk
- 1 cup (240 ml) dry white wine
- 2 cans (800 g total) San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 2 cups (480 ml) beef or chicken stock, preferably homemade
- 3 tbsp tomato paste
- 4 bay leaves
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp dried basil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese for serving

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

2. **Soffritto:**
   - Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook gently until the vegetables are soft and translucent, about 10-15 minutes. This is the "soffritto," which forms the flavour base of the sauce.

3. **Meat Browning:**
   - Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the ground beef and pork mix to the pot. Season lightly with salt. Cook until the meat is browned and the liquid it releases has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Make sure to break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks.

4. **Garlic:**
   - Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes, until fragrant.

5. **Milk:**
   - Pour in the whole milk. Simmer gently until the milk has evaporated. This step tenderizes the meat and balances acidity.

6. **Wine:**
   - Add the dry white wine. Simmer until most of the wine has evaporated. This deglazes the pan and adds complexity to the sauce.

7. **Tomatoes and Stock:**
   - Stir in the hand-crushed San Marzano tomatoes, beef stock, and tomato paste. Add the bay leaves, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper.

8. **Long Simmer:**
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer gently, uncovered, for 2.5 to 3 hours. Stir occasionally, ensuring the sauce does not stick to the bottom. Add a bit more stock or water if the sauce becomes too thick.

9. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove the bay leaves before serving.

10. **Serving:**
   - Serve the Bolognese sauce over your favourite pasta, such as tagliatelle or pappardelle. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a generous amount of grated Parmesan cheese.

### Chef Tips:
- **Soffritto:** Cook the soffritto slowly to build a deep flavour base.
- **Meat:** Browning the meat well is crucial for developing a rich, caramelized flavour.
- **Milk:** Use whole milk for its richness; this step is vital for a classic Bolognese.
- **Tomatoes:** San Marzano tomatoes are preferred for their sweetness and low acidity.
- **Simmer Time:** The long, slow simmer allows the flavours to meld and deepen.
- **Seasoning:** Season lightly throughout the cooking process and adjust at the end to avoid an overly salty sauce.

Enjoy your rich, classic Bolognese sauce!
