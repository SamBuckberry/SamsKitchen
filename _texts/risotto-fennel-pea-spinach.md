### Ingredients
- 1 large fennel bulb, finely chopped
- 2-3 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 1 cup fresh or frozen peas
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 50g unsalted butter
- 50g grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the stock:**
   - In a saucepan, bring the vegetable or chicken stock to a simmer. Keep it on low heat to stay warm.

2. **Cook the vegetables:**
   - In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion, garlic, fennel, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes.

3. **Add the rice:**
   - Add the Arborio rice to the pan with the vegetables. Stir to coat the rice with the oil and cook for about 2 minutes until the rice is slightly translucent.

4. **Add the wine:**
   - Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is fully absorbed by the rice.

5. **Cook the risotto:**
   - Start adding the warm stock, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until the stock is mostly absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is creamy and just tender.

6. **Add the peas:**
   - About 5 minutes before the risotto is done, add the peas. Stir to combine and continue cooking until the peas are tender and the risotto is done.

7. **Finish the risotto:**
   - Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Cover the pan and let the risotto sit for a couple of minutes.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve the risotto immediately, garnished with fresh basil or parsley if desired.

Enjoy your fennel, celery, and pea risotto!
